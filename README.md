===================

CS 3380 Final Project for Gunter-Hans.

Status: Complete.

This is one of the first websites I created. For my database course, we had to team up with various local businesses to create websites that would be useful for them. Gunter-Hans, a local Columbia bar, wanted a way to easily track and reference sales, as well as being able to forecast what future sales would look like. This site was our attempt at solving that problem. A variation of this site is still online and in use, however, because it contains information sensitive to that business, I can not publicly link to it here.
